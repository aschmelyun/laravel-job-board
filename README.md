## Laravel Job Board

This is an open-source job board application powered by Laravel, origially built for a [video tutorial series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZrOXG2B0dU&list=PL36CGZHZJqsWs907QwJrWSbN2g2NNPn6w&index=1) on YouTube. The goal of this is to let you self-host your own job board website, similar to larajobs.com or remoteok.io.

Included currently are features like:

- Individual SEO-friendly listing pages
- Payment processing through Stripe
- User account authentication
- A simple, mobile-friendly layout with TailwindCSS

**Note:** If you are coming from YouTube and are looking for the original code from the tutorial series, please see the [video-source](https://github.com/aschmelyun/laravel-job-board/tree/video-source) branch.

## Contributing

If you found a bug or would like to request a new feature, feel free to [create an issue](https://github.com/aschmelyun/laravel-job-board/issues/new) on this repo. Depending on how complex or elaborate it is, it will potentially be used as future content added on to the original video tutorial series. Pull requests are also welcome, and will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis!
